## Heart Disease Prediction with Jupyter Notebook

**Objective:**

* Develop a model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on various patient attributes.

**Technology:**

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn library (for Machine Learning algorithms)

**Process:**

The Jupyter Notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the heart disease dataset, explore its features, and understand the distribution of the target variable (presence/absence of heart disease).
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and potentially performing feature scaling.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train various Machine Learning algorithms on the prepared data. Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
4. **Model Selection:** Choose the best performing model based on the evaluation results.
5. **Model Explainability** Using SHAP to explain the best model.
